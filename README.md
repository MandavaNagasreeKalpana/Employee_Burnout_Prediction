# Employee_Burnout_Prediction
🧠 Employee Burnout Prediction Using Machine Learning
📌 Project Overview

Employee burnout has become a critical issue in modern workplaces, impacting productivity, mental health, and organizational performance. This project aims to predict employee burnout levels using machine learning models by analyzing work patterns and related factors.

The system uses data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and supervised learning models to accurately estimate burnout rates.

🎯 Objectives
